# Used_Car_Price_Prediction
Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. 
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car,  horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more.  If one ignores the brand of the car, a car manufacturer primarily fixes the price of a car based on the features it can offer  a customer. Later, the brand may raise the price depending on its goodwill, but the most important factors are what features  a car gives you to add value to your life. 
This is a real-world project that works with the machine learning algorithm. The main components of the project include the following: 
* Training data to extract meaningful insights 
* Visualizing data to find patterns among different factors 
* Implemented – linear regression algorithm  
The dataset I’m using here to train a car price prediction model was downloaded from Kaggle.  It contains data about all the main features that contribute to the price of a car.   
This project takes the parameters of an used car like: Company name, Model name, Year of Car Purchase, Fuel Type &amp;  Number of Kilometers it has been driven. It then predicts the possible price of the car , on which it can be re-saled .
